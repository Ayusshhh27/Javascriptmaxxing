JavaScript Revision Notes

Language Basics

- **Assignment**: Storing values in variables.
- **Strings**: Sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Arrays**: Ordered collections of values.
- **Functions**: Blocks of code that can be called and executed.
- **Methods**: Functions that are associated with objects.
- **Loops**:
  - **for loop**: Iterates through a block of code a specified number of times.
  - **while loop**: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
  - **do...while loop**: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.
  - **for...of loop**: Iterates over iterable objects such as arrays or strings.
  - **forEach() method**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
  - **Higher-order functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

DOM Manipulation and Events Handling

- **Events Handling**: Responding to user actions or browser events.

OOP and Error Handling

- **Error Handling**: Managing errors during execution.

Callbacks, Promises, async/await, Fetch API

- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to be executed later.
- **Promises**: Asynchronous operations handling.
- **async/await**: Simplified syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
- **Fetch API**: Modern interface for fetching resources.
